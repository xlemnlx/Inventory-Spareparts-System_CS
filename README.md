# Inventory-Spareparts-System_CS
To be summarize. Still finding it in my brain what this does specifically other than invetory.

This project is all about inserting / editing / and deleting datas in the SQL database by making it as a Inventory application

Unfortunately, the database is lost since the original laptop in which this project is made is not working anymore. As far as I remember the database is made from MSSQL Management Server 2014.

Originally on .NET 4.5 then converted it to 4.8.
